Task 7 - SQL

Create an application sql-jdbc-school that inserts/updates/deletes data in the database using JDBC.
Use PostgreSQL DB.

Tables (given types are Java types, use SQL analogs that fit the most:

groups(
	group_id int,
	group_name string
)
students(
	student_id int,
	group_id int,
	first_name string,
	last_name string
)
courses(
	course_id int,
	course_name string,
	course_description string
)
1. Create SQL files with data:

	a. create user and database. Assign all privileges on the database to the user. (DB and user should be created before application runs)

	b. create a file with tables creation

2. Create a java application

	a. On startup, it should run SQL script with tables creation from previously created files. If tables already exist - drop them.

	b. Generate test data:

		* 10 groups with randomly generated names. The name should contain 2 characters, hyphen, 2 numbers

		* Create 10 courses (math, biology, etc)

		* 200 students. Take 20 first names and 20 last names and randomly combine them to generate students.

		* Randomly assign students to groups. Each group could contain from 10 to 30 students. It is possible that some groups will be without students or students without groups

		* Create relation MANY-TO-MANY between tables STUDENTS and COURSES. Randomly assign from 1 to 3 courses for each student

3. Write SQL Queries, it should be available from the application menu:

	a. Find all groups with less or equals student count

	b. Find all students related to course with given name

	c. Add new student

	d. Delete student by STUDENT_ID

	e. Add a student to the course (from a list)

	f. Remove the student from one of his or her courses
